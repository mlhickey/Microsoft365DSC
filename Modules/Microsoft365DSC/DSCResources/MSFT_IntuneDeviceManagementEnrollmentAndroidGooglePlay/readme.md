# IntuneDeviceManagementEnrollmentAndroidGooglePlay

## Description

This resource configures Android Enterprise enrollment settings for device management within Microsoft Intune.
Note: Currently the bind API to enroll is waiting for the product team to make changes so the API can be called outside of an Intune portal. Until those changes are made, we can only unbind (disconnect/unenroll). For that reason we have commented out certain parameters that cannot be set. This will be uncommented once those changes are made.
